What is Finland searching for on Google right now?

What does Finland search through Google? What are the TOP 10 themes? And which country is the most searched for information about Tesla? And which, Espoo or Vantaa, is more desirable in the search engine?

These are the questions I'm looking for answers.

I am looking for answers to these questions. Google's Trends data was available on 10.10.2022. Google Trends is a website created by Google that analyzes the popularity of Google search queries in almost all regions, languages nd categories. I mined the data using Python's Pytrends library, from which I extracted almost everything available on the Google Trends website.
